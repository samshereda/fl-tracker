This is a web app used to track encounters and monsters in the tabletop roleplaying game Forbidden Lands

The app supports creating custom monsters, creating encounter templates with those monsters, and initializing the encounter templates as live encounters in which the user can decrease and increase enemy attributes as monsters take damage and heal.

Before you run the application, make sure the database setup in application.properties matches your database. Also, run the command `npm install` in the "fl-tracker" directory.

To start the backend, run FlTrackerBackendApplication.java in the src/main/java/com/example/flTrackerBackend package.

To start the frontend, run `npm start` in the "fl-tracker" directory.
